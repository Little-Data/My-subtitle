PA: Good morning,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,140

PA: The Black Mesa Compound is maintained
Shit...

00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:42,831
PA: at a pleasant 68 degrees
at all times.

19
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:46,290
I need to buy a watch; I'm already
on probation with the company.

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,406
They could fire me.

21
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,653
PA: This train is inbound from

22
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:50,317

Huh... what...?

36
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:25,553
PA: of the Transit System.
Yeah, "High Security"!

37
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:29,398
That's why we leave armed missiles
lying around for everyone to check out.

38
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:30,789
It's part of the tour.

39
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,343
PA: Due to the high toxicity of material

40
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,768

Fascists!

00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:44,787
Yeah, whatever, I'll drink a
40-ounce up here if I feel like it.

44
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:48,514
PA: Please keep your limbs
inside the train at all times.

45
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:51,642
Yeah, well, I'll stick my arms
out the window if I-- Okay, maybe not.

46
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:56,523
PA: ...until the train has complete
halt at the station platform.

47
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:59,074

PA: If it is necessary to exit the train,

51
00:02:06,748 --> 00:02:08,434
PA: disabled personnel should be

52
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:10,811
PA: evacuated first.
I should've been a pilot.

53
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:14,018
PA: Please, stay away from
electrified rails,

54
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:14,391
Hah!

55
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:16,697
PA: and proceed to an emergency station
Wow...

56
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:18,591
PA: until assistance arrives.

57
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:21,369
Man, how dumb would you have to be?

58
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:23,391
I mean, they're not gonna to say
something like that

59
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:26,033
unless somebody's already
tried to do it, right?

60
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,822
I guess if I was drunk enough, I
might climb out the window here

61
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:32,901
and pull some hangtime on the
electrified tram rail.

62
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:36,370
That kind of reminds me of that
squirrel that got caught

63
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,300
between the power lines
one day back at MIT.

64
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,698
The thing caught on fire and got
fused to the wires,

65
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:47,133
which caused a transformer to blow up
and knock out the power to all of campus.

66
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:51,834
That squirrel must've cost the
university at least $10,000.

67
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:53,095
That was a good day.

68
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:57,036
PA: A reminder that the Black
Mesa Hazard Course Decathlon

PA: Remember: more lives than
your own may depend on your fitness.

77
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:18,991
What? We're physicists.

78
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,723
PA: Do you have a friend or
relative who would make

79
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:24,518
PA: a valuable addition
to the Black Mesa Team?

80
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:25,544
I don't believe in friends.

PA: The Black Mesa Research Facility
is an equal-opportunity employer.

95
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,344
Man, they're still talking about hiring?

96
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:01,051
I guess my cousin Jessie needs a job.

97
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:03,323
If only he wasn't a sex-offender,

98
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:06,192
it would be so much easier to
find something for him.

God, the EPA is going to tear us apart

117
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:53,167
if they find out about that.

118
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,987
Well, I'm not saying anything.

119
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:58,420
I don't want to get called into
court as a witness on this

120
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,092
once the cat gets out of the bag.

121
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,931
PA: Please stand back from the
automated door

122
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:06,939

00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:07,710
Locked!

check your area for personal belongings.

125

PA: Thank you, and have a very
safe and productive day.

127
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:19,414
GUARD: Morning, Mr. Freeman.
Looks like you're runnin' late.

128
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:21,915
Yeah, you know what? I don't
even care anymore.

129
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:25,967
By the time I get suited up, I'm
going to be over an hour late.

130
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,367
I figure, I'm either fired or I'm not.

131
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:31,487
Is someone following me?

132
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:32,434
Okay, good.

133
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,368
Yeah, I'm just going to stroll in there
like I own the damned place,

134
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:39,767
take my time, maybe get some doughnuts...

135
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,850
If I'm fired, I could probably jack some
office supplies or computer equipment

136
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,467
or something on the way out.

137
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:48,500
I could just stuff things in a big
duffel bag, nobody's going to notice.

138
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:51,479
Hmm, y'know, Steve's never in his cubicle.

139
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,181
I could just walk right up and
take his laptop.

140
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:59,263
Hell! I could grab that color laser printer
from Accounting. That thing's nice!

141
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:02,477
That's gotta be worth a couple
grand right there.

142
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:05,300
Huh, I wonder if it can print money...
